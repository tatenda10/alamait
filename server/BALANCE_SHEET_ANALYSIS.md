## 🧮 Accounting Equation Validation

### Basic Accounting Equation:
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

### With Net Income:
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity + (Revenue - Expenses)
```

### Current Calculation:
```
$856.98 = $0.00 + $5,316.98 + ($10,960.00 - $15,420.00)
$856.98 = $0.00 + $5,316.98 + (-$4,460.00)
$856.98 = $0.00 + $856.98
$856.98 = $856.98 ✅ BALANCED
```

**Net Income (Loss): -$4,460.00** (Operating at a loss)

## 🔍 Logic Verification

### The controller correctly implements:

1. **Normal Balances:**
   - ✅ Assets: DEBIT (positive balance)
   - ✅ Liabilities: CREDIT (positive balance)
   - ✅ Equity: CREDIT (positive balance)
   - ✅ Revenue: CREDIT (positive balance)
   - ✅ Expenses: DEBIT (positive balance)

2. **Contra Accounts:**
   - ✅ Assets with negative balance → CREDIT side (e.g., Accounts Receivable -$3,053)
   - ✅ Liabilities with negative balance → DEBIT side
   - ✅ Equity with negative balance → DEBIT side (deficit)
   - ✅ Revenue with negative balance → DEBIT side (contra-revenue)
   - ✅ Expenses with negative balance → CREDIT side (contra-expense)

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   ```sql
   CASE 
     -- Assets & Expenses: Positive balance goes to DEBIT
     WHEN coa.type IN ('Asset', 'Expense') AND current_balance > 0 THEN current_balance
     
     -- Liabilities, Equity, Revenue: Negative balance goes to DEBIT (contra)
     WHEN coa.type IN ('Liability', 'Equity', 'Revenue') AND current_balance < 0 THEN 
       ABS(current_balance)
     ELSE 0
   END as debit_balance
   ```

4. **Total Calculations:**
   - ✅ Total Assets = Sum(Asset Debits) - Sum(Asset Credits)
   - ✅ Total Liabilities = Sum(Liability Credits) - Sum(Liability Debits)
   - ✅ Total Equity = Sum(Equity Credits) - Sum(Equity Debits)
   - ✅ Net Income = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
   - ✅ Total Equity with Income = Total Equity + Net Income
   - ✅ Balance Check = Assets = Liabilities + Equity + Net Income

## 📝 Important Notes

### 1. **Accounts Receivable is Negative (-$3,053)**
   - This is a **contra-asset** situation
   - It means students have **prepaid/overpaid** by $3,053 total
   - This reduces total assets
   - This is **correctly handled** in the balance sheet logic

### 2. **Operating at a Net Loss (-$4,460)**
   - Revenue: $10,960
   - Expenses: $15,420
   - Net Loss: -$4,460
   - This loss reduces equity, which is correct

### 3. **Opening Balance Equity ($5,316.98)**
   - This is used to balance the initial setup
   - Represents the starting financial position
   - Should eventually be closed to Retained Earnings

### 4. **Balance Sheet is Balanced**
   - Difference: $0.00
   - The accounting equation holds true
   - All debits equal all credits

## 🎯 Conclusion

**The balance sheet logic is 100% CORRECT.**

The controller properly:
- ✅ Classifies accounts by type
- ✅ Handles normal balances correctly
- ✅ Handles contra-account balances correctly
- ✅ Calculates totals accurately
- ✅ Validates the accounting equation
- ✅ Reports net income/loss correctly
- ✅ Balances Assets = Liabilities + Equity + Net Income

**No changes are needed to the balance sheet logic.**
