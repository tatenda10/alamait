# Petty Cash Accounting System - Enhanced Money Flow Tracking

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

Previously, when withdrawing money from petty cash, the system would:
- ✅ Decrease petty cash balance
- ❌ **NOT track where the money went**
- ❌ **NOT create proper accounting entries**
- ❌ **NOT maintain balance across accounts**

This created a "black hole" in accounting where money would disappear without proper tracking.

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Withdrawals (`withdrawCash`)**
- **Required Field**: `destination_account` - Where the withdrawn money goes
- **Valid Options**: 
  - `10002` - Cash (Cash on Hand)
  - `10003` - CBZ Bank Account  
  - `10004` - CBZ Vault
- **Accounting Entries**:
  - Debit destination account (money goes there)
  - Credit petty cash account (money leaves petty cash)
- **Balance Updates**: Both accounts are properly updated

### **2. Enhanced Additions (`addCash`)**
- **Required Field**: `source_account` - Where the money is coming from
- **Valid Options**: Same as destination accounts above
- **Accounting Entries**:
  - Debit petty cash account (money arrives)
  - Credit source account (money leaves source)
- **Balance Updates**: Both accounts are properly updated

## 📊 **Database Changes**

### **New Tables/Fields Used**
- `transactions` - Main transaction records
- `journal_entries` - Double-entry bookkeeping
- `current_account_balances` - Real-time account balances

### **Transaction Types**
- `petty_cash_withdrawal` - Money leaving petty cash
- `petty_cash_addition` - Money entering petty cash

## 🎨 **Frontend Changes**

### **Withdraw Modal**
- Added "Destination Account" dropdown
- Shows where withdrawn money will go
- Better user feedback

### **Add Cash Modal**  
- Added "Source Account" dropdown
- Shows where money is coming from
- Better user feedback

## 🔍 **How It Works**

### **Example 1: Withdraw $100 from Petty Cash to Bank**
```
1. User selects: destination_account = '10003' (CBZ Bank Account)
2. System creates:
   - Main transaction record
   - Petty cash transaction record
   - Journal entry: Debit Bank Account $100
   - Journal entry: Credit Petty Cash $100
3. Updates balances:
   - Petty Cash: -$100
   - CBZ Bank: +$100
```

### **Example 2: Add $200 to Petty Cash from Cash**
```
1. User selects: source_account = '10002' (Cash on Hand)
2. System creates:
   - Main transaction record
   - Petty cash transaction record
   - Journal entry: Debit Petty Cash $200
   - Journal entry: Credit Cash $200
3. Updates balances:
   - Petty Cash: +$200
   - Cash: -$200
```

## ✅ **Benefits**

1. **Complete Money Trail**: Every penny is accounted for
2. **Proper Double-Entry**: Full accounting compliance
3. **Real-Time Balances**: All account balances stay accurate
4. **Audit Trail**: Full transaction history with journal entries
5. **No More Black Holes**: Money can't disappear without explanation
